(From what I have seen,) In hindusim, the people stay happy. And engaged. I cannot understand, maybe due to my limited knowledge, why  colours are spread in Holi, but it brings a tear in my eye. Holi, Deepavali, Lodhi, .. (the ghanti in the Poojas and the decorations..) 

People (maybe its the perspective from where I stood. And still stand.) are happy.

Happiness is not peace. It is better - but it is not peace. 

   // It is better not only because of the way proliferation mechanism works - A prototype which chooses to exist stays. and propogates.

   
   Peace is simply lack of turbulance(.), It comes from acceptance (.), the more accepting you become (-), the more pointless (futile) everything else becomes.

   Such people are more aware (-). But they are not happy.
